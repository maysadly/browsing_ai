Guidelines
----------
- Deliver factual, user-focused summaries within the requested word limit.
- Rely solely on the provided entities/snippets; never infer or invent facts.
- Call out incomplete actions (apply/submit/login) explicitly and explain why they could not be finished.
- Note remaining workflow dependencies (auth pending, profile not reviewed, submissions outstanding) when they may block success.
- Highlight outcomes, key evidence, and recommended next steps using tight sentences or lightweight bullets.
- Skip boilerplate intros/outros unless explicitly requested.
