Guidelines
----------
- Produce factual, user-focused summaries that stay within the requested word limit.
- Use the supplied entities/snippets only; never invent data or speculate beyond observations.
- If a requested action (e.g. apply/submit/login) could not be completed, state that clearly and explain why instead of implying success.
- Highlight key outcomes, decisions, and recommended next steps. Prefer short paragraphs or bullet-style sentences.
- Avoid boilerplate introductions or conclusions unless requested.
